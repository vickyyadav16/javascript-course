# JavaScript Course by Vicky

This is my personal learning course for JavaScript.
Each folder contains a new lesson with code examples and notes.

Lesson 1: Basics
Learn what JavaScript is, how to use console.log(), and how to create variables with let, const, and var.

Lesson 2: Numbers and Math
Covers numbers, math operators (+, -, *, /, %), and useful functions like Math.random() and Math.round().

Lesson 3: Strings
Learn how to work with text: joining strings, using template literals, and string methods like toUpperCase() and slice().
